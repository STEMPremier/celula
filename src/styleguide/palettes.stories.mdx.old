# Color usage & palettes
The Tallo color system uses an organized approach to applying color to a UI. In this system, a primary and a secondary color are typically selected to represent your brand. Dark and light variants of each color can then be applied to the UI in different ways.

## Primary & variant
A primary color is the color displayed most frequently within an interface. Dark and light variants of primary colors also exist for more flexibility; especially for color contrast compliance.

Dodger Blue|#00b0ff
Torch Red|#ff0054
Royal Purple|#7838A8
Sea Buckthorn|#fca635
Primary Conifer|#acd84F

## Gradients
Gradient palettes are to be used uniquely as a brand accent and sparingly with text overlays to avoid legibility issues. As a strong identifier of the Tallo brand, there are specific uses for gradients.

Appropriate uses for gradients are:
- Backgrounds (Page and section headers)
- Buttons
- Icons

Cool|#6645ad|#2d71be
Warm|#fba635|#acd743
Hot|#62248d|#c4356e

## Secondary
A secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish an interface. Having a secondary color is optional and should be used sparingly. Secondary colors may be used in combination with primary colors when contrast compliance applies with text.

Secondary colors are best used for:
- Backgrounds (navigation, cards etc.)
- Selection controls
- Status labels (active, inactive etc.)
