## User Story
As developer, when I use the styleguide in my application, I should have a [COMPONENT] available to me.

## General Description
Create a [COMPONENT] component that should accept the following props (including any type info, defaults and/or restrictions):
- [ ] className
- ...

While styling make sure to include styles for the following states (beyond the default state) as necassary:
- [ ] active
- [ ] focused
- [ ] disabled
- [ ] inactive

Make sure any and all accessibility requirements for the [COMPONENT] are met.

**NOTE**: The reference designs make use of a unit, `PD`, that does not exist in CSS. Instead, as our render target is `px`, we will label all units accordingly (in the documentation); and we will use `rem` in our CSS.

## Tasks
