## User Story
As a user of the styleguide, when I am on the [SECTION] documentation page, I should see the documentation on [SECTION].

## General Description
Using markdown recreate the [design]() of our [SECTION] page.

**NOTE**: The reference designs make use of a unit, `PD`, that does not exist in CSS. Instead, as our render target is `px`, we will label all units accordingly (in the documentation); and we will use `rem` in our CSS.

## Tasks
- [ ] Markdown documentation

## Connections
Belongs to [GitHub Issue No.]
