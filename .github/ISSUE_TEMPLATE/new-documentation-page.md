## User Story
As a user of the styleguide, when I am on the [section] documentation page, I should see the documentation on [section].

## General Description
Using markdown recreate the [design](https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main?origin=v7#/console/18352821/381251961/preview?scrollOffset=0) of our [section] page.

**NOTE**: The reference designs make use of a unit, `PD`, that does not exist in CSS. Instead, as our render target is `px`, we will label all units accordingly (in the documentation); and we will use `rem` in our CSS.

## Tasks
- [ ] Markdown documentation

## Connections
Belongs to [GitHub Issue No.]
