## User Story
As a user of the styleguide, when I use the styleguide in my application, I should have the [SECTION] styles available to me in my application.

## General Description
Using Less, create the [SECTION] styles. Make sure to include all necassary `@media-queries` for any required sizes:

- [ ] Mobile (up to XXXpx)
- [ ] Tablet (between XXX+1px and YYYpx)
- [ ] Desktop (between YYY+1px and ZZZpx)
- [ ] Widescreen (ZZZ+1px and larger)

**NOTE**: The reference designs make use of a unit, `PD`, that does not exist in CSS. Instead, as our render target is `px`, we will label all units accordingly (in the documentation); and we will use `rem` in our CSS.

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
